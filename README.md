# Sentinel Anti-Cheat
Sentinel Anti-Cheat is the best free, open source Roblox anti-cheat available. Sentinel is fast, reliable, and follows a legitimate players first principal. Sentinel will always try to ban players that are guarunteed to be cheating, instead of false-banning actual players. Due to the nature of open source anti-cheats it is impossible to incorporate many of the checks that proprietary anti-cheats use. I've tried to make this as secure as possible, but I can't put any proprietary checks because they'll get patched as soon as I release this.

If you think that open source anti-cheats are stupid then just don't use it. This is just for small games that don't want to get bombarded with cheaters but also don't want to spend hours developing a custom anti-cheat for their game.
